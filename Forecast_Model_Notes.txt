## 🎯 Regression-Based Forecasting Logic

A **simple linear regression** model was implemented using DAX to predict future sales based on time (MonthIndex).

### ▶️ Regression Equation
```
Forecast = Intercept + Slope * MonthIndex
```

---

## 📐 Calculation of Slope and Intercept (Per SKU Category)

### ✅ Slope (b)
The slope is calculated using the formula:
```
b = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)
```

### ✅ Intercept (a)
Once the slope is known, the intercept is calculated as:
```
a = AvgY - b * AvgX
```

### ✅ In DAX:
```DAX
VAR Slope =
    DIVIDE(
        n * SUMX(MonthSummary, [MonthIndex] * [MonthlySales]) -
        SUMX(MonthSummary, [MonthIndex]) * SUMX(MonthSummary, [MonthlySales]),
        n * SUMX(MonthSummary, [MonthIndex] * [MonthIndex]) -
        POWER(SUMX(MonthSummary, [MonthIndex]), 2),
        0
    )

VAR Intercept =
    AVERAGEX(MonthSummary, [MonthlySales]) -
    Slope * AVERAGEX(MonthSummary, [MonthIndex])
```

---

## 📅 Filtering Logic

Only the most recent 12 months are used when computing slope/intercept and forecast accuracy to ensure relevance:
```DAX
MonthIndex >= CurrentMonthIndex - 12
```

---

## 📊 Forecast Evaluation Metrics

### ✅ MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
```
MAPE = SUMX(Actual-Forecast Table, ABS(Forecast - Actual)) / SUM(Actual)
```

### ✅ MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
```
MAE = AVERAGEX(Actual-Forecast Table, ABS(Forecast - Actual))
```

### ✅ RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
```
RMSE = SQRT(AVERAGEX(Actual-Forecast Table, (Forecast - Actual)^2))
```

These metrics were calculated for each SKU and visualized using Power BI.

## 🔍 Assumptions

- Forecasts are calculated **per SKU category**
- Data is **summarized by MonthIndex**
- Only completed months are included in error metrics
- Linear trend line is assumed (no seasonality)

---

## 📌 Purpose

This logic underpins the 3-month forecast table, the MAPE-by-SKU chart, and monthly forecast error visuals in the Power BI dashboard.
